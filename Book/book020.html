<h3 class="subsection" id="sec202"><span class="c006">The strange history of &#X201C;Think Python&#X201D;</span></h3>
<p><span class="c006">(Allen B. Downey)</span></p><p><span class="c006">In January 1999 I was preparing to teach an introductory programming
class in Java. I had taught it three times and I was getting
frustrated. The failure rate in the class was too high and, even for
students who succeeded, the overall level of achievement was too low.</span></p><p><span class="c006">One of the problems I saw was the books. 
They were too big, with too much unnecessary detail about Java, and
not enough high-level guidance about how to program. And they all
suffered from the trap door effect: they would start out easy,
proceed gradually, and then somewhere around Chapter 5 the bottom would
fall out. The students would get too much new material, too fast,
and I would spend the rest of the semester picking up the pieces.</span></p><p><span class="c006">Two weeks before the first day of classes, I decided to write my
own book. 
My goals were:</span></p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize"><span class="c006">Keep it short. It is better for students to read 10 pages
than not read 50 pages.</span></li><li class="li-itemize"><span class="c006">Be careful with vocabulary. I tried to minimize the jargon
and define each term at first use.</span></li><li class="li-itemize"><span class="c006">Build gradually. To avoid trap doors, I took the most difficult
topics and split them into a series of small steps. </span></li><li class="li-itemize"><span class="c006">Focus on programming, not the programming language. I included
the minimum useful subset of Java and left out the rest.</span></li></ul><p><span class="c006">I needed a title, so on a whim I chose <em>How to Think Like
a Computer Scientist</em>.</span></p><p><span class="c006">My first version was rough, but it worked. Students did the reading,
and they understood enough that I could spend class time on the hard
topics, the interesting topics and (most important) letting the
students practice.</span></p><p><span class="c006">I released the book under the GNU Free Documentation License,
which allows users to copy, modify, and distribute the book.</span></p><p><a id="hevea_default856"></a><span class="c005">
</span><a id="hevea_default857"></a></p><p><span class="c006">What happened next is the cool part. Jeff Elkner, a high school
teacher in Virginia, adopted my book and translated it into
Python. He sent me a copy of his translation, and I had the
unusual experience of learning Python by reading my own book.</span></p><p><span class="c006">Jeff and I revised the book, incorporated a case study by
Chris Meyers, and in 2001 we released <em>How to Think Like
a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python</em>, also under
the GNU Free Documentation License.
As Green Tea Press, I published the book and started selling
hard copies through Amazon.com and college book stores.
Other books from Green Tea Press are available at
<span class="c001">greenteapress.com</span>.</span></p><p><span class="c006">In 2003 I started teaching at Olin College and I got to teach
Python for the first time. The contrast with Java was striking.
Students struggled less, learned more, worked on more interesting
projects, and generally had a lot more fun.</span></p><p><span class="c006">Over the last five years I have continued to develop the book,
correcting errors, improving some of the examples and
adding material, especially exercises. In 2008 I started work
on a major revision&#X2014;at the same time, I was
contacted by an editor at Cambridge University Press who
was interested in publishing the next edition. Good timing!</span></p><p><span class="c006">I hope you enjoy working with this book, and that it helps
you learn to program and think, at least a little bit, like
a computer scientist.</span></p><h3 class="subsection" id="sec203"><span class="c006">Acknowledgements for &#X201C;Think Python&#X201D;</span></h3>
<p><span class="c006">(Allen B. Downey)</span></p><p><span class="c006">First and most importantly, I thank Jeff Elkner, who
translated my Java book into Python, which got this project
started and introduced me to what has turned out to be my
favorite language.</span></p><p><span class="c006">I also thank Chris Meyers, who contributed several sections
to <em>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</em>.</span></p><p><span class="c006">And I thank the Free Software Foundation for developing
the GNU Free Documentation License, which helped make
my collaboration with Jeff and Chris possible.</span></p><p><a id="hevea_default858"></a><span class="c005">
</span><a id="hevea_default859"></a></p><p><span class="c006">I also thank the editors at Lulu who worked on
<em>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</em>.</span></p><p><span class="c006">I thank all the students who worked with earlier
versions of this book and all the contributors (listed
in an Appendix) who sent in corrections and suggestions.</span></p><p><span class="c006">And I thank my wife, Lisa, for her work on this book, and Green
Tea Press, and everything else, too.</span></p><p><span class="c006">Allen B. Downey <br />
