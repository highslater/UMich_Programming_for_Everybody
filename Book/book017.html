<p><span class="c006">We have been reading data from files, networks, services,
and databases. Python can also go through all of the 
directories and folders on your computers and read those files
as well.</span></p><p><span class="c006">In this chapter, we will write programs that scan 
through your computer and 
perform some operation on each file. 
Files are organized into directories (also called &#X201C;folders&#X201D;).
Simple Python scripts
can make short work of simple tasks that must be done to 
hundreds or thousands of files
spread across a directory tree or your entire computer.</span></p><p><span class="c006">To walk through all the directories and files in a tree we use 
<span class="c001">os.walk</span> and a <span class="c001">for</span> loop. This is similar to how 
<span class="c001">open</span> allows us to write a loop to read the contents of a file,
<span class="c001">socket</span> allows us to write a loop to read the contents of a network connection, and
<span class="c001">urllib</span> allows us to open a web document and loop through its contents.</span></p><span class="c005">

</span><h2 class="section" id="sec192"><span class="c006">16.2&#XA0;&#XA0;Example: Cleaning up a photo directory</span></h2>
<p><span class="c006">Some time ago, I built a bit of Flickr-like software that 
received photos from my cell phone and stored those photos
on my server. I wrote this before Flickr existed and kept 
using it after Flickr existed because I wanted to keep original
copies of my images forever.</span></p><p><span class="c006">I would also send a simple one-line text description in the MMS message
or the subject line of the email message. I stored these messages
in a text file in the same directory as the image file. I came up 
with a directory structure based on the month, year, day, and time the 
photo was taken. The following would be an example of the naming for 
one photo and its existing description:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">./2006/03/24-03-06_2018002.jpg
./2006/03/24-03-06_2018002.txt
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">After seven years, I had a lot of photos and captions. Over the years
as I switched cell phones, sometimes my code to extract the caption from the message 
would break and add a bunch of useless data on my server instead of a caption. </span></p><p><span class="c006">I wanted to go through these files and figure out which of the 
text files were really captions and which were junk and then delete the bad
files. The first thing to do was to get a simple inventory of 
how many text files I had in one the subfolders
using the following program:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">import os
count = 0
for (dirname, dirs, files) in os.walk('.'):
   for filename in files:
       if filename.endswith('.txt') :
           count = count + 1
print 'Files:', count

python txtcount.py
Files: 1917
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">The key bit of code that makes this possible is the <span class="c001">os.walk</span>
library in Python. When we call <span class="c001">os.walk</span> and give it a starting
directory, it will &#X201C;walk&#X201D; through all of the directories 
and subdirectories recursively. The string &#X201C;.&#X201D; indicates
to start in the current directory and walk downward.
As it encounters each directory, we get three values in a tuple in the
body of the <span class="c001">for</span> loop. The first value is the current
directory name, the second value is the list of subdirectories 
in the current directory, and the third value is a list of files
in the current directory.</span></p><p><span class="c006">We do not have to explicitly look into each of the subdirectories
because we can count on <span class="c001">os.walk</span> to visit every 
folder eventually. But we do want to look at each file, so 
we write a simple <span class="c001">for</span> loop to examine each of the files 
in the current directory. We check each file to see if 
it ends with &#X201C;.txt&#X201D; and then count the number of 
files through the whole directory tree that end with the
suffix &#X201C;.txt&#X201D;.</span></p><p><span class="c006">Once we have a sense of how many files end with &#X201C;.txt&#X201D;, the next
thing to do is try to automatically
determine in Python which files are bad and which files
are good. So we write a simple program to print out the
files and the size of each file:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">import os
from os.path import join
for (dirname, dirs, files) in os.walk('.'):
   for filename in files:
       if filename.endswith('.txt') :
           thefile = os.path.join(dirname,filename)
           print os.path.getsize(thefile), thefile
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">Now instead of just counting the files, we create 
a file name by concatenating the directory name with
the name of the file within the directory using
<span class="c001">os.path.join</span>. It is important to use 
<span class="c001">os.path.join</span> instead of string concatenation 
because on Windows we use a backslash
(<code>\</code>) to construct file paths and on Linux
or Apple we use a forward slash (<code>/</code>) 
to construct file paths. The <span class="c001">os.path.join</span>
knows these differences and knows what system
we are running on and it does the proper concatenation
depending on the system. So the same Python code
runs on either Windows or Unix-style systems.</span></p><p><span class="c006">Once we have the full file name with directory
path, we use the <span class="c001">os.path.getsize</span> utility
to get the size and print it out, producing the 
following output:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">python txtsize.py

2578 ./2006/03/29-03-06_1355001.txt
...
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">Scanning the output, we notice that some files are pretty short and 
a lot of the files are pretty large and the same size (2578 and 2565). 
When we take a look at a few of these larger files by hand, 
it looks like the large 
files are nothing but a generic bit of identical HTML that came 
in from mail sent to my system from my T-Mobile phone:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">&lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/title&gt;
...
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">Skimming through the file, it looks like there is no good information
in these files so we can probably delete them.</span></p><p><span class="c006">But before we delete the files, we will write a program to look for files
that are more than one line long and show the contents of the file.
We will not bother showing ourselves those files that are exactly
2578 or 2565 characters long since we know that these files have no useful
information.</span></p><p><span class="c006">So we write the following program:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">import os
from os.path import join
for (dirname, dirs, files) in os.walk('.'):
   for filename in files:
       if filename.endswith('.txt') :
           thefile = os.path.join(dirname,filename)
           size = os.path.getsize(thefile)
           if size == 2578 or size == 2565:
               continue
           fhand = open(thefile,'r')
           lines = list()
           for line in fhand:
               lines.append(line)
           fhand.close()
           if len(lines) &gt; 1:
                print len(lines), thefile
                print lines[:4]
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">We use a <span class="c001">continue</span> to skip files with the two 
&#X201C;bad sizes&#X201D;, then open the rest of the files
and read the lines of the file into a Python list
and if the file has more than one line we print
out how many lines are in the file and print out
the first three lines.</span></p><p><span class="c006">It looks like filtering out those two bad file sizes, and assuming
that all one-line files are correct, we are down to some pretty clean
data:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">python txtcheck.py 
3 ./2004/03/22-03-04_2015.txt
['Little horse rider\r\n', '\r\n', '\r']
2 ./2004/11/30-11-04_1834001.txt
['Testing 123.\n', '\n']
3 ./2007/09/15-09-07_074202_03.txt
['\r\n', '\r\n', 'Sent from my iPhone\r\n']
3 ./2007/09/19-09-07_124857_01.txt
['\r\n', '\r\n', 'Sent from my iPhone\r\n']
3 ./2007/09/20-09-07_115617_01.txt
...
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">But there is one more annoying pattern of files: 
there are some three-line files that consist of
two blank lines followed by a line that says
&#X201C;Sent from my iPhone&#X201D; that have slipped 
into my data. So we make the following change
to the program to deal with these files as well.</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">           lines = list()
           for line in fhand:
               lines.append(line)
           if len(lines) == 3 and lines[2].startswith('Sent from my iPhone'):
               continue
           if len(lines) &gt; 1:
                print len(lines), thefile
                print lines[:4]
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">We simply check if we have a three-line file, and if the third 
line starts with the specified text, we skip it.</span></p><p><span class="c006">Now when we run the program, we only see four remaining 
multi-line files and all of those files look pretty reasonable:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">python txtcheck2.py 
3 ./2004/03/22-03-04_2015.txt
['Little horse rider\r\n', '\r\n', '\r']
2 ./2004/11/30-11-04_1834001.txt
['Testing 123.\n', '\n']
2 ./2006/03/17-03-06_1806001.txt
['On the road again...\r\n', '\r\n']
2 ./2006/03/24-03-06_1740001.txt
['On the road again...\r\n', '\r\n']
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">If you look at the overall pattern of this program,
we have successively refined how we accept or reject
files and once we found a pattern that was &#X201C;bad&#X201D; we used
<span class="c001">continue</span> to skip the bad files so we could refine
our code to find more file patterns that were bad.</span></p><p><span class="c006">Now we are getting ready to delete the files, so 
we are going to flip the logic and instead of printing out 
the remaining good files, we will print out the &#X201C;bad&#X201D;
files that we are about to delete.</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">import os
from os.path import join
for (dirname, dirs, files) in os.walk('.'):
   for filename in files:
       if filename.endswith('.txt') :
           thefile = os.path.join(dirname,filename)
           size = os.path.getsize(thefile)
           if size == 2578 or size == 2565:
               print 'T-Mobile:',thefile
               continue
           fhand = open(thefile,'r')
           lines = list()
           for line in fhand:
               lines.append(line)
           fhand.close()
           if len(lines) == 3 and lines[2].startswith('Sent from my iPhone'):
               print 'iPhone:', thefile
               continue
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">We can now see a list of candidate files that we are about
to delete and why these files are up for deleting.
The program produces the following output:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">python txtcheck3.py

...
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">We can spot-check these files to make sure that we did not inadvertently
end up introducing a bug in our program or perhaps our logic 
caught some files we did not want to catch.</span></p><p><span class="c006">Once we are satisfied that this is the list of files we want to delete,
we make the following change to the program:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">           if size == 2578 or size == 2565:
               print 'T-Mobile:',thefile

               os.remove(thefile)
               continue
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">In this version of the program, we will both print the file out 
and remove the bad files
using <span class="c001">os.remove</span>.</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">python txtdelete.py

...
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">Just for fun, run the program a second time and it will produce no output
since the bad files are already gone.</span></p><p><span class="c006">If we rerun <span class="c001">txtcount.py</span> we can see that we have removed
899 bad files:
</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">python txtcount.py 
Files: 1018
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">In this section, we have followed a sequence where we use Python 
to first look through directories and files seeking
patterns. We slowly use Python to help determine what we 
want to do to clean up our directories. Once we
figure out which files are good and which files are 
not useful, we use Python to delete the files and 
perform the cleanup.</span></p><p><span class="c006">The problem you may need to solve can either be quite simple 
and might only depend on looking at the names of files,
or perhaps you need to read every single file and
look for patterns within the files. Sometimes 
you will need to read all the files and make a change 
to some of the files. All of these are pretty 
straightforward once you understand how <span class="c001">os.walk</span>
and the other <span class="c001">os</span> utilities can be used.</span></p><span class="c005">
</span><h2 class="section" id="sec193"><span class="c006">16.3&#XA0;&#XA0;Command-line arguments</span></h2>
<p><a id="hevea_default828"></a></p><p><span class="c006">In earlier chapters, we had a number of programs that prompted
for a file name using <code>raw_input</code> and then read data 
from the file and processed the data as follows:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">name = raw_input('Enter file:')
handle = open(name, 'r')
text = handle.read()
...
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">We can simplify this program a bit by taking the file name
from the command line when we start Python. Up to now,
we simply run our Python programs and respond to the 
prompts as follows:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">python words.py
Enter file: mbox-short.txt
...
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">We can place additional strings after the Python file and access
those <span class="c009">command-line arguments</span> in our Python program. Here is a simple program 
that demonstrates reading arguments from the command line:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">import sys
print 'Count:', len(sys.argv)
print 'Type:', type(sys.argv)
for arg in sys.argv:
   print 'Argument:', arg
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">The contents of <span class="c001">sys.argv</span> are a list of strings where the first string
is the name of the Python program and the remaining strings are the arguments
on the command line after the Python file.</span></p><p><span class="c006">The following shows our program reading several command-line arguments from the command
line:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">python argtest.py hello there
Count: 3
Type: &lt;type 'list'&gt;
Argument: argtest.py
Argument: hello
Argument: there
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">There are three arguments are passed into our program as a three-element list. 
The first element of the list is the file name (argtest.py) and the others are 
the two command-line arguments after the file name.</span></p><p><span class="c006">We can rewrite our program to read the file, taking the file name 
from the command-line argument as follows:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">import sys

name = sys.argv[1]
handle = open(name, 'r')
text = handle.read()
print name, 'is', len(text), 'bytes'
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">We take the second command-line argument as the name of the file (skipping past
the program name in the <span class="c001">[0]</span> entry). We open the file and read 
the contents as follows:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">python argfile.py mbox-short.txt
mbox-short.txt is 94626 bytes
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">Using command-line arguments as input can make it easier to reuse your Python programs, 
especially when you only need to input one or two strings.</span></p><span class="c005">

comes from the need to verify if data was garbled as it was 
sent across a network or written to a backup medium and then
read back in. When the data is written or sent, the sending system
computes a checksum and also sends the checksum. When the 
data is read or received, the receiving system re-computes
the checksum from the received data and compares it to the 
received checksum. If the checksums do not match, we must
assume that the data was garbled as it was transferred.
