</span><a id="hevea_default411"></a></p><p><span class="c006">So far, we have learned how to write programs and communicate 
our intentions to the <span class="c009">Central Processing Unit</span> using conditional
execution, functions, and iterations. We have learned how to 
create and use data structures in the <span class="c009">Main Memory</span>. The CPU 
and memory are where our software works and runs. It is where 
all of the &#X201C;thinking&#X201D; happens. </span></p><p><span class="c006">But if you recall from our hardware architecture discussions,
once the power is turned off, anything stored in either
the CPU or main memory is erased. So up to now, our
programs have just been transient fun exercises to learn Python.</span></p><div class="center"><span class="c006"><img src="book010.png" /></span></div><p><span class="c006">In this chapter, we start to work with <span class="c009">Secondary Memory</span> 
(or files).
Secondary memory is not erased even when the power is turned off. 
Or in the case of a USB flash drive, the
data we write from our programs can be removed from the 
system and transported to another system.</span></p><p><span class="c006">We will primarily focus on reading and writing text files such as 
those we create in a text editor. Later we will see how to work
with database files which are binary files, specifically designed to be read
and written through database software.</span></p><span class="c005">

</span><a id="hevea_default414"></a></p><p><span class="c006">When we want to read or write a file (say on your hard drive), we first
must <span class="c009">open</span> the file. Opening the file communicates with your operating
system, which knows where the data for each file is stored. When you open
a file, you are asking the operating system to find the file by name
and make sure the file exists. In this example, we open the file 
<span class="c001">mbox.txt</span>, which should be stored in the same folder that you
are in when you start Python.
You can download this file from 
<span class="c001">www.py4inf.com/code/mbox.txt</span></span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">&gt;&gt;&gt; fhand = open('mbox.txt')

&lt;open file 'mbox.txt', mode 'r' at 0x1005088b0&gt;
</span></pre><p><a id="hevea_default415"></a><span class="c006">
If the <span class="c001">open</span> is successful, the operating system returns us a 
<span class="c009">file handle</span>. The file handle is not the actual data contained
in the file, but instead it is a &#X201C;handle&#X201D; that we can use to 
read the data. You are given a handle if the requested file
exists and you have the proper permissions to read the file.</span></p><div class="center"><span class="c006"><img src="book011.png" /></span></div><p><span class="c006">If the file does not exist, <span class="c001">open</span> will fail with a traceback and you 
will not get a handle to access the contents of the file:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">&gt;&gt;&gt; fhand = open('stuff.txt')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'stuff.txt'
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">Later we will use <span class="c001">try</span> and <span class="c001">except</span> to deal more gracefully
with the situation where we attempt to open a file that does 
not exist.</span></p><span class="c005">

<p><span class="c006">A text file can be thought of as a sequence of lines, much like a Python
string can be thought of as a sequence of characters. For example, this

Subject: [sakai] svn commit: r39772 - content/branches/
Details: http://source.sakaiproject.org/viewsvn/?view=rev&amp;rev=39772
...
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">The entire file of mail interactions is available from 
<span class="c001">www.py4inf.com/code/mbox.txt</span> 
and a shortened version of the file is available from
<span class="c001">www.py4inf.com/code/mbox-short.txt</span>.
These files are in a standard format for a file containing 
multiple mail messages. The lines which start with 
&#X201C;From &#X201D; separate the messages and the lines which start 
with &#X201C;From:&#X201D; are part of the messages. 
For more information about the mbox format, see 
<span class="c001">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox</span>. </span></p><p><span class="c006">To break the file into lines, there is a special character that 
represents the &#X201C;end of the line&#X201D; called the <span class="c009">newline</span> character.</span></p><p><a id="hevea_default416"></a><span class="c006">
In Python, we represent the <span class="c009">newline</span> character as a backslash-n in 
string constants. Even though this looks like two characters, it
is actually a single character. When we look at the variable by entering
&#X201C;stuff&#X201D; in the interpreter, it shows us the <code>\n</code> in the string, 
but when we use <span class="c001">print</span> to show the string, we see the string broken
into two lines by the newline character.</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">&gt;&gt;&gt; stuff = 'Hello\nWorld!'
&gt;&gt;&gt; stuff
'Hello\nWorld!'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print stuff
Hello
World!
&gt;&gt;&gt; stuff = 'X\nY'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print stuff
X
Y
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(stuff)
3
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">You can also see that the length of the string <code>'X\nY'</code> is <em>three</em>
characters because the newline character is a single character.</span></p><p><span class="c006">So when we look at the lines in a file, we need to <em>imagine</em>
that there is a special invisible character called the newline at
the end of each line that marks the end of the line. </span></p><p><span class="c006">So the newline character separates the characters 
in the file into lines.</span></p><span class="c005">

</span><a id="hevea_default418"></a><span class="c006">
While the <span class="c009">file handle</span> does not contain the data for the file,
it is quite easy to construct a <span class="c001">for</span> loop to read through 
and count each of the lines in a file:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">fhand = open('mbox.txt')
count = 0
for line in fhand:
    count = count + 1
print 'Line Count:', count

python open.py 
Line Count: 132045
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">We can use the file handle as the sequence in our <span class="c001">for</span> loop. 
Our <span class="c001">for</span> loop simply counts the number of lines in the 
file and prints them out. The rough translation of the <span class="c001">for</span>
loop into English is, &#X201C;for each line in the file represented by the file
handle, add one to the <span class="c001">count</span> variable.&#X201D;</span></p><p><span class="c006">The reason that the <span class="c001">open</span> function does not read the entire file
is that the file might be quite large with many gigabytes of data.
The <span class="c001">open</span> statement takes the same amount of time regardless of the
size of the file. The <span class="c001">for</span> loop actually causes the data to be 
read from the file.</span></p><p><span class="c006">When the file is read using a <span class="c001">for</span> loop in this manner, Python
takes care of splitting the data in the file into separate lines using
the newline character. Python reads each line through 
the newline and includes
the newline as the last character in the <span class="c001">line</span> variable for each 
iteration of the <span class="c001">for</span> loop.</span></p><p><span class="c006">Because the <span class="c001">for</span> loop reads the data one line at a time, it can efficiently
read and count the lines in very large files without running 
out of main memory to store the data. The above program can 
count the lines in any size file using very little memory since 
each line is read, counted, and then discarded.</span></p><p><span class="c006">If you know the file is relatively small compared to the size of 
your main memory, you can read the whole file into one string
using the <span class="c001">read</span> method on the file handle.</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">&gt;&gt;&gt; fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
&gt;&gt;&gt; inp = fhand.read()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print len(inp)
94626
&gt;&gt;&gt; print inp[:20]
From stephen.marquar
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">In this example, the entire contents (all 94,626 characters) 
of the file <span class="c001">mbox-short.txt</span> are read directly into the 
variable <span class="c001">inp</span>. We use string slicing to print out the first
20 characters of the string data stored in <span class="c001">inp</span>.</span></p><p><span class="c006">When the file is read in this manner, all the characters including 
all of the lines and newline characters are one big string 
in the variable <span class="c009">inp</span>. 
Remember that this form of the <span class="c001">open</span> function should only be used
if the file data will fit comfortably in the main memory 
of your computer.</span></p><p><span class="c006">If the file is too large to fit in main memory, you should write
your program to read the file in chunks using a <span class="c001">for</span> or <span class="c001">while</span>
loop.</span></p><span class="c005">
</span><h2 class="section" id="sec93"><span class="c006">7.5&#XA0;&#XA0;Searching through a file</span></h2>
<p><span class="c006">When you are searching through data in a file, it
is a very common pattern to read through a file, ignoring most
of the lines and only processing lines which meet a particular condition.
We can combine the pattern for reading a file with string methods
to build simple search mechanisms.</span></p><p><a id="hevea_default419"></a><span class="c005">
</span><a id="hevea_default420"></a><span class="c006">
For example, if we wanted to read a file and only print out lines
which started with the prefix &#X201C;From:&#X201D;, we could use the 
string method <span class="c009">startswith</span> to select only those lines with
the desired prefix:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    if line.startswith('From:') :
        print line
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">When this program runs, we get the following output:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">From: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za

From: louis@media.berkeley.edu

From: zqian@umich.edu

From: rjlowe@iupui.edu
...
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">The output looks great since the only lines we are seeing are those 
which start with &#X201C;From:&#X201D;, but why are we seeing the extra blank
lines? This is due to that invisible <span class="c009">newline</span> character.
Each of the lines ends with a newline, so the <span class="c001">print</span> 
statement prints the string in the variable <span class="c009">line</span> which includes
a newline and then <span class="c001">print</span> adds <em>another</em> newline, resulting
in the double spacing effect we see.</span></p><p><span class="c006">We could use line slicing to print all but the last character, but 
a simpler approach is to use the <span class="c009">rstrip</span> method which strips
whitespace from the right side of a string as follows:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if line.startswith('From:') :
        print line
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">When this program runs, we get the following output:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">From: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za

From: cwen@iupui.edu
...
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">As your file processing programs get more complicated, you may want 
to structure your search loops using <span class="c001">continue</span>. The basic idea 
of the search loop is that you are looking for &#X201C;interesting&#X201D; lines
and effectively skipping &#X201C;uninteresting&#X201D; lines. And then when we
find an interesting line, we do something with that line.</span></p><p><span class="c006">We can structure the loop to follow the
pattern of skipping uninteresting lines as follows:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    # Skip 'uninteresting lines'
    if not line.startswith('From:') :
        continue
    # Process our 'interesting' line
    print line
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">The output of the program is the same. In English, the 
uninteresting lines are those which do not start 
with &#X201C;From:&#X201D;, which we skip using <span class="c001">continue</span>.
For the &#X201C;interesting&#X201D; lines (i.e., those that start with &#X201C;From:&#X201D;)
we perform the processing on those lines.</span></p><p><span class="c006">We can use the <span class="c001">find</span> string method to simulate a text editor
search that finds lines where the search string is anywhere in the line. 
Since <span class="c001">find</span> looks for an occurrence of a string within another
string and either returns the position of the string or -1 if the string
was not found, we can write the following loop to show lines which
contain the string &#X201C;@uct.ac.za&#X201D; (i.e., they come from the University 
of Cape Town in South Africa):</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if line.find('@uct.ac.za') == -1 : 
        continue
    print line
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">Which produces the following output:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008

to break your programs&#X2014;either on purpose or with malicious intent.
As a matter of fact, an important part of any software development
team is a person or group called <span class="c009">Quality Assurance</span> (or QA for short)
whose very job it is to do the craziest things possible in an attempt
to break the software that the programmer has created.</span></p><p><a id="hevea_default421"></a><span class="c005">
</span><a id="hevea_default422"></a><span class="c006">
The QA team is responsible for finding the flaws in programs before 
we have delivered the program to the end users who may be purchasing the
software or paying our salary to write the software. So the QA team
is the programmer&#X2019;s best friend.</span></p><p><a id="hevea_default423"></a><span class="c005">

</span><a id="hevea_default428"></a><span class="c006">
So now that we see the flaw in the program, we can elegantly fix it using
the <span class="c001">try</span>/<span class="c001">except</span> structure. We need to assume that the <span class="c001">open</span>
call might fail and add recovery code when the <span class="c001">open</span> fails
as follows:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">fname = raw_input('Enter the file name: ')

        count = count + 1
print 'There were', count, 'subject lines in', fname
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">The <span class="c001">exit</span> function terminates the program. It is a function
that we call that never returns. Now when our user (or 
QA team) types in silliness or bad file names, 
we &#X201C;catch&#X201D; them and recover gracefully:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">python search7.py

Protecting the <span class="c001">open</span> call is a good example 
of the proper use of <span class="c001">try</span>

&#X201C;Pythonic&#X201D; when we are doing something the &#X201C;Python

the Pythonic way to open a file.</span></p><p><span class="c006">Once you become more skilled in Python, you can engage
in repartee with other Python programmers to decide
which of two equivalent solutions to a problem is 
&#X201C;more Pythonic&#X201D;. The goal to be &#X201C;more Pythonic&#X201D; 
captures the notion that programming is part engineering
and part art. We are not always interested
in just making something work, we also want
our solution to be elegant and to be appreciated as 
elegant by our peers.</span></p><span class="c005">

</span><a id="hevea_default435"></a></p><p><span class="c006">When you are reading and writing files, you might run into problems
with whitespace. These errors can be hard to debug because spaces,
tabs, and newlines are normally invisible:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">&gt;&gt;&gt; s = '1 2\t 3\n 4'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print s
1 2  3
 4

</span><a id="hevea_default437"></a><span class="c005">
</span><a id="hevea_default438"></a></p><p><span class="c006">The built-in function <span class="c001">repr</span> can help. It takes any object as an
argument and returns a string representation of the object. For
strings, it represents whitespace
characters with backslash sequences:</span></p><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004">&gt;&gt;&gt; print repr(s)
'1 2\t 3\n 4'
</span></pre><p><span class="c006">This can be helpful for debugging.</span></p><p><span class="c006">One other problem you might run into is that different systems
use different characters to indicate the end of a line. Some
systems use a newline, represented <code>\n</code>. Others use
a return character, represented <code>\r</code>. Some use both.
If you move files between different systems, these inconsistencies
might cause problems.</span></p><p><a id="hevea_default439"></a></p><p><span class="c006">For most systems, there are applications to convert from one
format to another. You can find them (and read more about this
issue) at <span class="c001">wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline</span>. Or, of course, you
could write one yourself.</span></p><span class="c005">

Sometimes when programmers get bored or want to have a bit of fun,
they add a harmless <span class="c009">Easter Egg</span> to their program 
(<span class="c001">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)</span>). Modify the program
that prompts the user for the file name so that it prints a funny
message when the user types in the exact file name &#X201C;na na boo boo&#X201D;. 
The program should behave normally for all other files which exist
and don&#X2019;t exist. Here is a sample execution of the program:</em></span><pre class="verbatim"><span class="c004"><em>python egg.py
